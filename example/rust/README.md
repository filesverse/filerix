### Resolving "Error: libfilerix.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" in Node.js

If you encounter the following error in your Node.js application:

```
Error: libfilerix.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

This typically indicates that Node.js is unable to locate the required shared library (`libfilerix.so`). To resolve this, update the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable by running the following command:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

This ensures that Node.js can properly locate the `libfilerix.so` library in `/usr/local/lib64/`. 

For persistence across sessions, you may want to add this line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`).
